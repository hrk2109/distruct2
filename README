# distruct2
Implements user defined pop order and colors in 'distruct.py' from fastStructure (Raj et al 2014)

This is a modified version of the distruct.py script originally written by Anil Raj and available at www.github.com/rajanil/fastStructure.  It allows the end user to input the desired population order and color scheme for the output plot.  The color hack was implemented by Karl C. Fetter of University of Vermont.

An example using the test data from fastStructure is provided and includes the following files:
```bash
distruct2.py (modified python script)
TestK3.png (output file)
pop (popfile)
run.sh (execute distruct2)
testoutput_simple.3.log (fastStructure output log)
testoutput_simple.3.meanP (fastStructure K=3 allele frequencies)
testoutput_simple.3.meanQ (fastStructure K=3 ancestry coefficients)
```

<h3> To Download </h3>
```bash
mkdir ~/projects
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/cryptic0/distruct2
```

Then take a look at ```run.sh```.  Also open 'distruct2.py' in your favorite text editor and examine ```L11``` and ```L72``` for color and pop order settings respectively.  Run the test data by executing ```./run.sh``` and make sure everything works correctly before attempting with your own data.
